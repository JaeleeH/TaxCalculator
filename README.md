# Future Work

<!-- {Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.} -->

- In the future, I can inclue calculations depending on the state of residency.
- I can also include medicare and social security taxes based on the state.
- I could make the program more efficient by pulling the numbers from a dictionary or list.
